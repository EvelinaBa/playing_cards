# Card game "War" with Python

This is a first coding project and the aim is to make a card game with Python.

Flow of the game:
1. In this version of the card game "War" there are two players. 
2. In the case of two players there has to be an equal amount of cards, so a standard deck of 52 cards is used. The deck consists of four suits, each suit contains 13 cards: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King. Neither suit nor color has any matter in this game.
3. The deck of 52 cards is randomly split into two parts for each player. 
4. One card is revealed for each player and the cards are compared, the player that has a higher ranking card, takes the cards.
5. If both cards are of the same value, two more cards are drawn and revealed. The player with the higher value cards takes all the cards, if the cards are still the same, another two cards are revealed until a winner of the round is determined, who takes all of the revealed cards.
6. When one of the players runs out of cards, then the previously collected cards come to play. The winner is the player who ends up with the entire deck.
