# Card game "War" with Python

This is a first coding project and the aim is to make a card game with Python.

Flow of the game:
1. This version of the card game "War" has two players. 
2. A standard deck of 52 cards is used. The deck consists of four suits, each suit contains 13 cards: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King. Neither suit nor color has any matter in this game.
3. The deck of 52 cards is randomly split into two parts for each player, now each player has his own deck of 26 cards.
4. The value of the cards is defined, the cards are ranked from highest to lowest as follows: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King.
5. For each turn, one card is randomly pulled for both players out of that players deck. The cards are compared and the winner of the round is determined. 
6. If the cards are of the same value, neither player gets a point.
7. At the end of the game, the total of the points for each player is counter.
